### Executive Summary
This is the course project for the Regression Models class. The goal of this project is to analyze the <code>mtcars</code> data set and the relationship between a set of variables within that data set and miles per gallon (MPG) as the dependent variable.  Two particular questions of interest are:

        * Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
        * What is the quantified MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?

The analysis shows us that the average MPG of manual tranmission cars is slightly higher than automatic transmission cars.  Holding other variables constant, manual transmission cars yield <strong>0.18</strong> higher MPG than automatic cars. 

### Data Exploratory
```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
require(datasets); data(mtcars); require(GGally); require(ggplot2); require(car)
str(mtcars)
```
First, we do some basic data exploration to see the relationship between variables of the data set. <strong>Firgure 1-1</strong> (Appendix) is a box plot that shows the different in MPG of two different groups of cars, based on their transmissions.  From the plot, it appears that manual transmission cars have a better MPG than automatic transmission cars.  Mean values are <strong>24.392</strong>, for manual cars and <strong>17.147</strong>, for automatic cars.

A pairs plot, which shows us the relationship between variables, (see Figure 1-2 in the Appendix) can tell us that variables like <code>disp</code>, <code>wt</code> and <code>cyl</code> are highly correlated with the dependent variable mpg.  The variables <code>wt</code> and <code>disp</code> have high correlations.  It makes common sense since a larger car (or a higher displacement car) will have a higher weight.  Thus we just need to include one of these two variables in building our regression models; and in this case, we pick <code>wt</code> for its higher correlation to <code>mpg</code>.  However, the questions of interest focus on how transmission type effects on the mpg.  We include variable  <code>am</code> in our model. 

### Inference analysis
We perform a t-test on two group of cars; one with manual transmissions and the other with automatic transmissions. In doing this test, we assume that the data is normally distributed and that the two groups of cars are unpaired and have different variances.
```{r echo = TRUE}
t.test(mpg ~ factor(am), data = mtcars, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE, alternative="two.sided")
```
We gather from the test results that the p-value is <strong>0.001374</strong> which is very small; and the 95% confidence interval is from <strong>-11.280194</strong>  to <strong>-3.209684</strong> which doesn't contain 0.  So far, we may say manual transmission cars yield higher mpg than automatic transmission cars.

### Regression analysis
```{r echo = TRUE}
# nesting models
fit1 <- lm(mpg ~ factor(am), data = mtcars)
fit2 <- update(fit1, mpg ~ factor(am) + wt)
fit3 <- update(fit1, mpg ~ factor(am) + wt + cyl)
anova(fit1, fit2, fit3)
```
The <code>fit3</code> model which consists of the variables <code>wt</code> and <code>cyl</code> as cofounders and <code>am</code> as the the indepedent variable is the best model.  The results from the above ANOVA test demonstrates <code>fit3</code> achieves the most significant p-value.

Adjusted R-squared of <code>fit3</code> is <strong>0.8122</strong> (see Output 3 - Appendix).  This is almost as high as the adjusted R-squared of the model which includes all variables, <strong>0.8066</strong> (see Output 4 - Appendix).  Therefore, we can confidently report that <code>fit3</code> model captures 82% of variability and it is the best model.

Based on the summary outpuf of <code>fit3</code> (Output 3 - Appendix), we conclude from our best fit model <code>fit3</code> that cars with manual transmission get slightly better <strong>0.18</strong> MPG than cars with automatic transmission.

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit3)
```

- In the upper left hand plot, Residuals Vs Fitted, data points lie under and above zero, excepts some outliers, and seem not to have any obvious pattern. It supports the indepedent condition of the data.
- Normal Q-Q plot indicates the data is normally distributed.

The above observations reaffirm our conclusion of the <code>fit3</code> model.
